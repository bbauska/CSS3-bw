    <h2>LFS170x - Blockchain: Understanding Its Uses and Implications </h2>
 
Course Overview 
Blockchain technology is changing how business is executed. It’s important to understand why blockchain is different and how it works in comparison with technologies of the past. 
The first segment covers all the main concepts of what blockchain is. It discusses how it began as a triple ledger system first introduced for the administration of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, and how it is now applied to all aspects of business including government, banking, supply chains, and a host of other industries. 
It also analyzes the concept of transparent ledgers, both public and permissioned, and focuses on using cryptography to achieve consensus, immutability, and governance of transactions. This is all part of blockchain’s ability to provide “trusted data from untrusted sources”, disrupting traditional accounting methodologies and international trade. 
The course then dives into the various methods of blockchain governance that currently exist in the marketplace as well as how consensus fits into governance. It explores how to reach consensus through proof-of-work or proof-of-stake.  
Other aspects of the course include examining the very specific features of blockchain that solve problems that have been difficult to overcome in the past with more centralized architectures. 
The final part of the course takes a deep dive into the various use cases of blockchain, complete with analyzing real examples of how different industries are executing the technology and improving their business. Examining a problem, and then depicting a blockchain use case that solves the problem, will help gain an understanding of how blockchain is applied to real world situations.

edX Platform 
If you are using edX for the first time, we strongly encourage you to start by taking a free 'how to use edX' course that the team at edX has made available. In this course, you will learn how to navigate the edX platform, how to connect with other edX learners, how to answer problems on the edX platform, how grades work in edX courses, and how to complete your first course. 
Click her​ e to register for “DemoX​ ​” and you will be on your way. You will find the edX platform simple and intuitive. 
Getting Help 
For any technical issues with the edX platform (including login problems and issues with the Verified Certificate), please use the Help​ icon located on the upper right side of your screen.​	 
One great way to interact with peers taking this course and resolving any content-related​ issues is via the ​ Discussion Forums​ . These forums can be used in the following ways:​	 
⦁	To discuss concepts, tools, and technologies presented in this course, or related to the topics discussed in the course material. ● To ask questions about course content. 
⦁	To share resources and ideas related to blockchain. 
We strongly encourage you not only to ask questions, but to share with your peers opinions about the course content, as well as valuable related resources. The Discussion Forums will be reviewed periodically by The Linux Foundation staff, but it is primarily a community resource, not an 'ask the instructor' service.  
To learn more tips on how to use them, read the following article: "Gettin​ g the Most Out of the edX Discussion Forums​". 
Course Timing 
This course is entirely self-paced; there is no fixed schedule for going through the material. You can go through the course at your own pace, and you will always be returned to exactly where you left off when you come back to start a new session. However, we still suggest you avoid long breaks in between periods of work, as learning will be faster and content retention improved. 
The chapters in the course have been designed to build on one another. It is probably best to work through them in sequence; if you skip or only skim some chapters quickly, you may find there are topics being discussed you have not been exposed to yet. But this is all self-paced and you can always go back, so you can thread your own path through the material. 
Learning Aids 
Besides simple exposition through text and figures, this course uses several additional methods to present the learning material, including videos, use cases, labs, and knowledge check questions (​ Verified Certificate track only).​ 
Audit and Verified Tracks 
You can enroll into an audit or a verified track. In an audit track, you will have access to all ungraded course content: course readings, videos, and learning aids, but no certificates are awarded when auditing. You will not be able to access any graded content (knowledge check questions at the end of each chapter, and the final exam). 
In order to receive a certificate, you will need to obtain a passing grade (please refer to the “Grading” section below), verify your identity with edX, and pay a fee. Once all edX requirements have been met, you can download your certificate from the Progress tab. 
To learn more about audit and verified tracks, visit edX Help Center > Certificate​	s.​ 
Grading ​ (​ Verified Certificate track only) 
At the end of each chapter, you will have a set of graded knowledge​ check questions,​ that are meant to further check your understanding of the material presented. The grades obtained by answering these knowledge check questions will represent 20​ % of your final grade.​ 
The remaining 80​ % of your final grade is represented by the score obtained in the final​ exam.​ The final exam is located at the end of the course and it consists of 20 questions.  
You will have a maximum of two attempts to answer each knowledge check and final exam question (other than True/False questions, in which case, you have only one attempt). You are free to reference your notes, screens from the course, etc., and there is no time limit on how long you can spend on a question. You can always skip a question and come back to it later. 
In order to complete this course with a passing grade, you must obtain a passing score 
(knowledge check and final exam) of minimum 70%.​ 
Course Progress and Completion ​ (​ Verified Certificate track only) 
Once you complete the course (including knowledge check questions and final exam), you will want to know if you have passed. You will be able to see your completion status using the Progress tab at the top of your screen, which will clearly indicate whether or not you have achieved a passing score.
